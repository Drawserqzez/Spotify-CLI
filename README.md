# Spotify CLI

This is a small hobby-project that makes a CLI for Spotify made with .NET C#.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Clone my [CLI-Tools](https://www.github.com/Drawserqzez/CLI-Tools) repository
3. Start coding :)

## Todo

- [ ] Make an error handler
- [ ] Make commands to do things
- [ ] Make a template for the config-file
- [ ] Start TDD instead of doing bad things
