# Spotify CLI

This is a small hobby-project that makes a CLI for Spotify made with .NET C#.

## Setup
0. Clone or fork this repository
1. Add github-packages to your nuget-sources, because a dependency of this project is [my CLI library](https://github.com/Drawserqzez/CLI/)
2. Start coding :)

## Todo

- [ ] Make an error handler
- [ ] Make commands to do things
- [x] Make a template for the config-file
- [x] If no config file is found, guide the user to create one
- [ ] Start TDD instead of doing bad things
